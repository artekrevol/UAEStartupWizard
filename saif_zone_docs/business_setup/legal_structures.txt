# SAIF Zone Legal Structures

## Free Zone Establishment (FZE)
A limited liability entity with a single shareholder. The minimum capital requirement varies by license type. FZE is suitable for individual entrepreneurs or small businesses looking to establish a presence in the UAE with full ownership.

## Free Zone Company (FZC)
A limited liability entity with multiple shareholders (2-5). The minimum capital requirement varies by license type. FZC is ideal for partnerships or joint ventures that want to maintain full ownership of their UAE operations.
