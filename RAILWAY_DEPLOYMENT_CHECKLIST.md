# Railway Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to guide you through the Railway deployment process after all the fixes we've implemented.

## Pre-Deployment
- [x] Fix railway.toml to remove health check configuration
- [x] Create fix-cheerio-import.js script for cheerio module import fix
- [x] Update build command in railway.toml to include cheerio fix
- [x] Create documentation (RAILWAY_HEALTHCHECK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md, UPDATED_RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Deployment Steps

1. [ ] Install Railway CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. [ ] Login to Railway:
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```
   
   * When prompted, visit the URL and enter the pairing code shown in the terminal
   * Wait for the login confirmation

3. [ ] Link to your project:
   ```bash
   railway link
   ```
   
   * Select your workspace
   * Select the UAEStartupWizard project
   * Select the production environment

4. [ ] Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```
   
   * This will build and deploy your application according to your railway.toml configuration

5. [ ] Run the cheerio fix if needed:
   ```bash
   railway run node fix-cheerio-import.js
   ```

6. [ ] Initialize the database if this is a fresh deployment:
   ```bash
   railway run node railway-setup.js
   ```

7. [ ] Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   railway run npm run db:push
   ```

8. [ ] Verify your deployment:
   ```bash
   railway open
   ```

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Check the application logs for any errors:
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

- [ ] Monitor the application in the Railway dashboard:
   ```bash
   railway dashboard
   ```
