# Replit Deployment Guide (HTTP-Only Version)

This guide explains how to deploy the UAE Business Setup Assistant on Replit by completely replacing Playwright with an HTTP-only solution.

## Deployment Issues and Solutions

The application originally used Playwright for web scraping, but this causes deployment issues on Replit due to browser binary dependencies. After multiple failed deployment attempts, we've implemented a complete solution:

1. Removing Playwright completely from the application
2. Replacing it with a pure HTTP-based scraper using Axios
3. Creating a clean deployment build without any browser dependencies

## New Approach: HTTP-Only Scraper

Instead of trying to disable Playwright, we've now created a completely separate implementation:

- A new `HttpOnlyScraper` class that provides similar functionality using Axios
- Modified server code that doesn't import Playwright at all
- A clean build process that filters out all Playwright dependencies

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### 1. Build a Playwright-free Deployment Version

Run our deployment build script:

```bash
./make-deployment.sh
```

This script:
- Creates a `build-deployment` directory with a clean copy of the project
- Replaces all Playwright-based scraping with HTTP-only alternatives
- Removes all Playwright dependencies from package.json
- Sets up all necessary configuration files

### 2. Deploy the Clean Build

1. Change to the deployment build directory:
   ```bash
   cd build-deployment
   ```

2. Click the "Deploy" button in your Replit project

3. Your application will be available at your Replit deployment URL

## Verifying Deployment

After deployment, you can verify that the application is working correctly by:

1. Checking the deployment logs for the message "Initializing HTTP-only scraper"
2. Confirming there are no Playwright-related errors
3. Testing the application's data retrieval functionality

## Technical Details

### HTTP-Only Scraper Implementation

The new HTTP-only scraper:
- Uses Axios with robust configuration to handle various web servers
- Implements fallback approaches for challenging websites
- Provides similar API methods to the original scraper but without browser dependencies
- Handles common scraping tasks like page fetching, data extraction, and file downloads

### Complete Playwright Removal

This approach differs from previous attempts:
- Instead of trying to skip Playwright installation, we remove it completely
- No Playwright dependencies remain in the deployed code
- All browser-dependent code is replaced with HTTP-only alternatives

### Build Process

The build process:
1. Creates a clean copy of the project
2. Filters out all Playwright references and dependencies
3. Adds the HTTP-only scraper implementation
4. Configures the application to use the HTTP-only implementation
5. Sets up all necessary environment variables and configuration files

This ensures a completely clean deployment without any Playwright dependencies.
