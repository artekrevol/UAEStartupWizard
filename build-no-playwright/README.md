# UAE Business Setup Assistant - Deployment Build

This is a deployment-ready build of the UAE Business Setup Assistant, with all Playwright dependencies removed.

## Features

- Uses HTTP-only scraping for data collection
- No browser dependencies required
- Optimized for production deployment

## Deployment Instructions

1. Make sure all environment variables are set (especially API keys)
2. Run the deployment script:
   ```

   ```
3. Deploy the built application to your hosting provider

## HTTP-Only Mode

This build operates in HTTP-only mode, which means:

- No Playwright or browser dependencies are required
- The application is more lightweight and deployment-friendly

Note that some advanced scraping features might be limited in this mode,
but all critical functionality is preserved.
