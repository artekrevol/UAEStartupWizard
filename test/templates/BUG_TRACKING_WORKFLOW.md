# Bug Tracking Workflow

This document outlines the process for reporting, tracking, and resolving bugs in the UAE Business Setup Platform.

## Bug Lifecycle

```
[NEW] → [TRIAGE] → [PRIORITIZED] → [IN PROGRESS] → [REVIEW] → [VERIFIED] → [CLOSED]
                         ↓                             ↓
                   [DEFERRED] ←-----------------→ [REOPENED]
```

## Bug States

1. **NEW**
   - Initial state when a bug is first reported
   - Contains basic description and reproduction steps

2. **TRIAGE**
   - Bug is evaluated by a technical lead
   - Severity and impact are assessed
   - Duplicates are identified and merged

3. **PRIORITIZED**
   - Bug has been assigned a priority level
   - Scheduled for a specific sprint or timeframe
   - Assigned to a developer

4. **IN PROGRESS**
   - Developer is actively working on a fix
   - Implementation details are documented

5. **REVIEW**
   - Fix has been implemented and submitted for review
   - Code review and testing in progress

6. **VERIFIED**
   - Fix has passed all tests
   - Original reporter confirms the bug is resolved

7. **CLOSED**
   - Bug is fully resolved and documentation updated
   - Lessons learned are captured if applicable

8. **REOPENED**
   - Bug has recurred after previously being closed
   - Returns to the IN PROGRESS state

9. **DEFERRED**
   - Bug is valid but not scheduled for immediate fix
   - Will be reconsidered in a future sprint

## Prioritization Framework

### Severity Levels

- **Critical (P1)**
  - System crash, data loss, security breach
  - Complete work stoppage for users
  - No workaround available
  - Must be fixed immediately

- **High (P2)**
  - Major feature is broken or severely limited
  - Significant user impact
  - Workarounds are difficult or unreliable
  - Should be fixed in current sprint

- **Medium (P3)**
  - Feature partially broken
  - Limited user impact
  - Reasonable workaround exists
  - Scheduled based on overall roadmap

- **Low (P4)**
  - Minor issues, UI inconsistencies
  - Minimal user impact
  - Easy workaround available
  - Fixed when convenient

### Prioritization Factors

Priority is determined by considering:
1. Number of users affected
2. Business impact
3. Visibility to customers
4. Relationship to upcoming releases
5. Complexity of the fix

## Reporting Guidelines

1. Use the standard bug report template (`BUG_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`)
2. Include clear reproduction steps
3. Provide evidence (screenshots, logs)
4. Specify environment details
5. Indicate severity and impact

## Response Time Expectations

- **Critical (P1)**: Immediate attention, fix within 24 hours
- **High (P2)**: Investigation within 24 hours, fix within current sprint
- **Medium (P3)**: Investigation within 3 days, scheduled in prioritized backlog
- **Low (P4)**: Investigation within 1 week, scheduled when resources available

## Tools and Integration

- Bug reports tracked in issue tracking system
- Integration with project management tools
- Automated notifications for status changes
- Regular bug triage meetings

## Metrics and Reporting

The team tracks the following metrics:

- Average time to resolution by severity
- Bug density per module
- Bug reopen rate
- Bug find/fix ratio per sprint
- Age of open bugs

## Continuous Improvement

The bug tracking process is reviewed quarterly to identify:

- Common root causes
- Process bottlenecks
- Areas needing additional test coverage
- Opportunities for developer training

Remember: The goal is not just to fix bugs but to improve the overall quality of the platform and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
