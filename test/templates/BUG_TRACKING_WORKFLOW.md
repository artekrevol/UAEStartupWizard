# Bug Tracking Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the standardized process for reporting, tracking, and resolving bugs in the UAE Business Setup Platform. Following this workflow ensures that all issues are properly documented, prioritized, and resolved efficiently.

## Bug Life Cycle

```
NEW → VALIDATED → IN PROGRESS → FIXED → TESTING → CLOSED
                                              ↓
                                           REOPENED
                      ↓
                   REJECTED
```

### Status Definitions

1. **NEW**
   - Bug has been reported but not yet reviewed by the QA team
   - Action: QA team to review and validate

2. **VALIDATED**
   - Bug has been confirmed and is ready for fixing
   - Action: Development team to prioritize and assign

3. **IN PROGRESS**
   - Developer is actively working on a fix
   - Action: Developer to implement solution

4. **FIXED**
   - Developer has implemented a fix
   - Action: QA to test the fix

5. **TESTING**
   - QA is validating the fix
   - Action: QA to verify the fix resolves the issue

6. **CLOSED**
   - Bug has been verified as fixed
   - No further action required

7. **REOPENED**
   - Fix did not resolve the issue
   - Action: Return to developer with additional information

8. **REJECTED**
   - Bug report is invalid, not reproducible, or intentional behavior
   - Action: Document reason for rejection

## Severity Classifications

### Critical
- System crash or data loss
- Security breach
- Complete failure of core feature
- Blocking issue with no workaround
- Example: Users cannot login, payment processing fails, data corruption

### High
- Major functionality affected, but workarounds exist
- Significant usability issue
- Important feature partially broken
- Example: Certain documents can't be uploaded, comparison tool shows incorrect data

### Medium
- Minor functionality affected
- Non-core features
- Usability issue with easy workaround
- Example: UI alignment issues, minor form validation errors

### Low
- Cosmetic issues
- Typos
- UI improvements
- Example: Button color inconsistency, minor text formatting issues

## Priority Classifications

### Immediate
- Must be fixed immediately
- Blocking development or release
- Business-critical issue
- Action: Address within 24 hours

### High
- Should be fixed in the current sprint
- Significantly impacts user experience
- Important for business requirements
- Action: Address within the current iteration

### Medium
- Should be fixed in the next sprint
- Moderate impact on user experience
- Action: Schedule for next iteration

### Low
- Can be fixed when resources are available
- Minimal impact on user experience
- Action: Add to backlog

## Bug Reporting Process

1. **Discovery**
   - Tester or user identifies potential issue
   - Gather initial information

2. **Reproduction**
   - Attempt to reproduce the issue consistently
   - Document exact steps to reproduce

3. **Documentation**
   - Fill out bug report template completely
   - Include screenshots or videos
   - Classify severity and priority

4. **Submission**
   - Submit bug report to issue tracking system
   - Tag relevant stakeholders

5. **Triage**
   - QA team reviews and validates bug
   - Confirms or adjusts severity/priority
   - Assigns to appropriate developer

## Resolution Process

1. **Assignment**
   - Developer is assigned the bug
   - Changes status to IN PROGRESS

2. **Investigation**
   - Developer investigates root cause
   - Documents findings in the bug report

3. **Implementation**
   - Developer implements fix
   - Adds unit tests to prevent regression
   - Updates status to FIXED

4. **Code Review**
   - Another developer reviews the fix
   - Approves or requests changes

5. **QA Verification**
   - QA tests the fix in testing environment
   - Verifies bug is resolved
   - Updates status to CLOSED or REOPENED

6. **Documentation**
   - Document the fix in release notes
   - Update technical documentation if needed

## Metrics and Reporting

Track the following metrics for continuous improvement:

- **Bug Detection Rate**: Number of bugs found per testing phase
- **Bug Density**: Number of bugs per feature or module
- **Fix Rate**: Number of bugs fixed per time period
- **Average Resolution Time**: Time from report to closure
- **Reopen Rate**: Percentage of bugs that are reopened after being "fixed"
- **Bug Distribution**: By severity, priority, and component

## Tools

- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub Issues or JIRA
- **Documentation**: Bug report template (Markdown)
- **Evidence Collection**: Screenshots, screen recordings
- **Communication**: Team chat and email notifications

## Communication Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid assigning blame
- Focus on facts and reproduction steps
- Be specific about expected vs. actual behavior
- Update stakeholders on critical bugs promptly
