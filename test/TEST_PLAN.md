# UAE Business Setup Platform - Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and approach for the UAE Business Setup Platform. The test plan covers various testing methodologies, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, performance tests, and security tests.

## Testing Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation.

#### Test Areas
- Validation utilities
- Data transformation functions
- Business logic modules
- Utility functions

#### Test Framework
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript unit tests

#### Example Tests
- Validation functions test (`test/unit/shared/validation.test.js`)
- Data transformation test (`test/unit/shared/transforms.test.js`)

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work correctly when combined.

#### Test Areas
- API endpoints
- Database interactions
- Service communication

#### Test Framework
- Jest with Supertest for API testing

#### Example Tests
- Free zone API test (`test/integration/api/freezones.test.ts`)
- Document management API test (`test/integration/api/documents.test.ts`)
- User authentication flow test (`test/integration/auth/login.test.ts`)

### 3. End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests simulate real user interactions with the application.

#### Test Areas
- User registration flow
- Free zone comparison functionality
- Document upload and management
- Business setup wizard

#### Test Framework
- Playwright for browser automation

#### Example Tests
- Registration flow test (`test/e2e/registration/registration-wizard.spec.ts`)
- Free zone comparison test (`test/e2e/freezone/freezone-comparison.spec.ts`)

### 4. Performance Tests

Performance tests evaluate the responsiveness, stability, and resource usage of the application.

#### Test Areas
- Page load times
- API response times
- System behavior under load

#### Test Framework
- Lighthouse for web performance metrics
- k6 for load testing (planned)

#### Example Tests
- Lighthouse performance audit (`test/performance/lighthouse/run-lighthouse.js`)
- API load test (planned)

### 5. Security Tests

Security tests identify vulnerabilities and ensure proper security measures are in place.

#### Test Areas
- Authentication and authorization
- Data protection
- API security
- Input validation

#### Test Framework
- OWASP ZAP for automated security scanning (planned)
- Manual security review

#### Example Tests
- Authentication security test (`test/security/auth/authentication.test.ts`)
- API security test (`test/security/api/endpoints.test.ts`)

## Test Environment

### Local Development
- Node.js v20.x
- PostgreSQL database
- Test against local server (http://localhost:5000)

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated tests run on pull requests
- Full test suite run on deployment

## Test Data Management

- Use seed data for testing
- Reset database to known state before tests
- Use separate test database from production

## Bug Reporting Process

1. Identify and reproduce the issue
2. Fill out bug report template (`test/templates/BUG_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`)
3. Add bug to tracking system
4. Prioritize based on severity and impact
5. Assign for resolution

## Test Coverage Goals

- Unit tests: 80% code coverage for utility functions and business logic
- Integration tests: 100% coverage of API endpoints
- E2E tests: Cover all critical user journeys
- Performance: All pages must score at least 80 on Lighthouse
- Security: Zero high or critical vulnerabilities

## Continuous Improvement

The test suite will be continuously improved based on:
- New feature additions
- Bug reports and their root causes
- Performance bottlenecks identified
- Security vulnerabilities discovered

## Maintenance

- Tests to be updated when related features change
- Regular review of test coverage
- Periodic audit of test quality

### Setting Up the Test Environment

To run tests locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure test environment: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.test`
4. Start the test database (if needed)
5. Run tests: `npm test`

### Running Specific Test Categories

- Unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
- Integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- Performance tests: `npm run test:performance`
- Security tests: `npm run test:security`
