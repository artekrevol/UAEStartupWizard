## 2. Bug Tracking Workflow

### 2.1 Bug Report Template

```markdown
## Bug Report

### Title
[Concise summary of the issue]

### Description
[Detailed explanation of the bug and its impact]

### Steps to Reproduce
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [...]

### Expected Behavior
[What should happen]

### Actual Behavior
[What actually happens]

### Environment
- **Browser/Device**: [e.g., Chrome 90, iPhone 12]
- **OS**: [e.g., Windows 10, iOS 14]
- **Screen Size**: [if relevant]
- **User Role**: [if applicable]

### Visual Evidence
[Screenshots or videos demonstrating the issue]

### Severity
[Critical/High/Medium/Low]

### Priority
[Immediate/High/Medium/Low]

### Additional Context
[Any other relevant information]
```

### 2.2 Severity Classification

- **Critical**: System crash, data loss, security breach, or complete feature failure
- **High**: Major functionality affected, but workarounds exist
- **Medium**: Minor functionality affected, non-core features
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, typos, UI improvements

### 2.3 Priority Classification

- **Immediate**: Must be fixed immediately, blocking development/release
- **High**: Should be fixed in the current sprint
- **Medium**: Should be fixed in the next sprint
- **Low**: Can be fixed when resources are available

### 2.4 Bug Life Cycle

1. **New**: Bug is reported but not yet reviewed
2. **Validated**: Bug is confirmed and ready for fixing
3. **In Progress**: Developer is working on the fix
4. **Fixed**: Developer has implemented a fix
5. **Testing**: QA is validating the fix
6. **Closed**: Bug is verified as fixed
7. **Rejected**: Bug report is invalid or not reproducible

## 3. Test Execution Strategy

### 3.1 Unit Testing

- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock dependencies
- Focus on business logic correctness
- Aim for >90% code coverage

### 3.2 Integration Testing

- Test interactions between modules
- Validate data flow between components
- Test database interactions
- Include API contract testing

### 3.3 End-to-End Testing

- Complete user journeys
- Real environment (or close simulation)
- Cross-functional workflows
- Focus on business requirements

### 3.4 Regression Testing

- Run after each bug fix
- Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality
- Prioritize critical paths
- Leverage automation for efficiency

## 4. Continuous Testing
