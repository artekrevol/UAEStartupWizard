# Replit Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying the UAE Business Setup Assistant on Replit using the minimal deployment version.

## Why This Approach?

The original application uses Playwright for web scraping, which causes deployment issues on Replit due to browser binary dependencies. After multiple failed deployment attempts, we've created this minimal deployment version as a solution.

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Deployment Files

The minimal deployment version is contained in the `minimal-deploy` directory. This version:
- Has ZERO dependencies on Playwright
- Uses a simplified server implementation
- Contains only essential functionality
- Is optimized for deployment on Replit

### 2. Build the Application

Navigate to the minimal-deploy directory and run the build script:

```bash
cd minimal-deploy
node build.js
```

This will create the necessary files and directories for deployment.

### 3. Deploy on Replit

1. Create a new Replit project
2. Upload the files from the `minimal-deploy` directory
3. Click the "Run" button to make sure it works locally
4. Click the "Deploy" button to deploy the application

### 4. Verify Deployment

After deployment:
1. Visit your deployment URL
2. Verify that the application is running correctly
3. Check that the API status endpoint returns a successful response

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Missing Required Files

Solution: Make sure you've run `node build.js` before deployment to create all necessary files.

### Issue: Deployment Still Fails

Solution: Check that your Replit project is using the correct entry point (`index.js`) and that you have the minimal dependencies in your `package.json`.

## Making Updates

To update the deployed application:

1. Make changes to the files in the `minimal-deploy` directory
2. Run `node build.js` again to rebuild
3. Redeploy on Replit

## Future Improvements

In the future, you may want to:

1. Gradually add back functionality using HTTP-only APIs
2. Add database integration for dynamic content
3. Implement additional API endpoints

But always ensure that any added functionality does not depend on Playwright or other browser automation tools.
